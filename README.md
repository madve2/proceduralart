Simple fork of marian42's beautiful work, "Every Planet Procedural", aiming to package it as an offline-functioning Windows 10 app, offering new features.

The current version lets the user set the generated image as their desktop wallpaper by just clicking a button. Auto-updating the wallpaper with a newly-generated images every day (hour, minute...) is planned :)
